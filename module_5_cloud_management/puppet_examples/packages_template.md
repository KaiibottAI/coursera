There's a module named packages on the Puppet VM instance that takes care of installing the packages that are needed on the machines in the fleet. 
```
class packages {
   package { 'python-requests':
       ensure => installed,
   }
   if $facts[os][family] == "Debian" {
     package { 'golang':
       ensure => installed,
     }
  }
   if $facts[os][family] == "RedHat" {
     package { 'nodejs':
       ensure => installed,
     }
  }
}
